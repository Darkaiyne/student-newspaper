            The serious shortage of physicians and dentists this nation <sic>laces</sic> is a fact ac­
            knowledged by federal experts and public alike. However, one of the least known
            aspects of this problem is the appalling shortage of black physicians and dentists.
            Among white <choice> <original = A m e r i c a n s> Americans </choice>, one out of every 670 is a physician but among black </cb>
          </p>
          <p>
            Americans, only one in 5,000 practices medicine. Whereas there is one dentist for
            every 1,750 Americans there is only one black dentist for every 10,000 black Americans.
            The crux of the problem is that there </cb>
          </p>
          <p>
            are far too few black college students who enter medical and dental schools. There appear
            to be four principal <sic>rea­ sons</sic> that these schools are not attract­ing a sufficient number of qualified Negro
            applicants. </p>
            <p>The first reason is that among Negro college students, many lack the life-long <choice> <original = a c a d e m i c>
            academic </choice> preparation necessary to pursue the highly demanding and com­petitive pre-dental and pre-medical cur­
            ricula. </p>
            <p> Secondly, a lack of communication exists between medical and dental schools and black
            undergraduates, resulting in a belief among the latter that racial origin is a serious deterrent to a
            career in medicine or dentistry. </p>
            <p> The third reason is that many black students feel the cost of dental or med­ical education would be prohibitive. </p>
            <p> The fourth is that many black students are unaware of the opportunities which
            would be opened to them as physicians and dentists. </p>
            <p> We feel that these four reasons should
            not deter any black student on this cam­pus from the attainment of worthwhile careers in dentistry or medicine. </p>
            <p> For the black student who finds his background inadequate in any subject, he can readily obtain tutoring assistance by </p> </cb>
            <p> <quote> The various clinical colleges and academies, like the American College
            of Surgeons and the American Col­lege of Physicians have practically eliminated their racial bars so that Negro physicians are admitted
            Just as others, as soon as properly qualified and sponsored. </p>
            <p> Similarly, the <choice> <original = v a r i o u s> various </choice> specialty boards certify Negro physicians as
            specialists without <sic> restrict!cm </sic> when they have met the respective training requirements and passed the examin­ations. </cb>
          </p>
          <p>
            For the black student who needs finan­cial assistance, there are numerous <choice> <original = a w a r d s> awards </choice> available from professional schools, medical societies, Federal and
            state governments, and various other sources. </p>
          <p> <choice> <original = A g a i n> Again </choice> quoting from Ebony, "Today there are more medical school openings available to Negro students than
            there can be found qualified applicants to fill. <emph> *For example, Harvard Medical School plans to provide at least 15 scholarships per class for disadvantaged
            students. </emph> For the black student, a career in den­tistry or medicine offers the opportunity for a constructive role in attaining social, economic, and political
            equality in any community. President Johnson proclaimed to mem­bers of the National Medical Associa­tion in a recent address that Negro professional men
            must be their <emph> "broth­ers' keepers* </emph> and <quote>"...must provide the leadership, the brains and courage." </quote> The Pre-Dental and Pre-Medical so­cieties strongly urge any
            black students interested in these professions to in­vestigate our programs.
